Log4E Manual Configuration Example
----------------------------------

This example configures a series of loggers using a programmatic approach.
That is, all loggers are created and configured in code.

After compiling, run the example using:

	log4e_manual_config

You will find three log files created with a series of log messages. See the
comments in the source for an explaination of each logger.

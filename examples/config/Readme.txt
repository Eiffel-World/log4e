Log4E Configuration Examples
----------------------------

The examples in this directory demonstrate how to configure log4e in
an application.

The example in the 'manual' directory configures a series of loggers
using a programmatic approach.

The 'xml' example uses an XML file to configure the same set of loggers
as in the manual example.
